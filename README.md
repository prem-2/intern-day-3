A container typically uses a fixed or responsive width to center or align content, while container-fluid expands to take up the full width of the viewport, allowing the design to adjust dynamically to different screen sizes. These layout techniques are crucial for creating responsive web pages that look great on both large and small screens.

: On Day 3, interns will focus on expanding their HTML skills to create structured and dynamic webpages. This includes mastering the fundamental HTML tags, learning how to organize content efficiently, and understanding how to structure pages to ensure accessibility and readability.

Learning Goals:

Basic HTML Structure: Review of the foundational HTML elements like <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>. Interns will practice how to use these elements to set up the structure of a webpage.

Text Formatting and Structure:

Use of headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to organize content hierarchically.
Paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), and links (<a href="...">) to improve content readability and navigation.
Introduction to text formatting tags like <b>, <i>, <u>, and the importance of semantic HTML for accessibility.
Images and Multimedia:

Inserting images using the <img> tag with proper attributes like src and alt for accessibility.
Introduction to embedding videos and audio files, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
HTML Forms:

Introduction to basic HTML forms (<form>, <input>, <button>, etc.).
Learn how to create forms for user input (e.g., contact forms, registration forms) and understand the importance of form accessibility (labeling and validating inputs).
Tasks:

Develop a basic webpage that incorporates structured text, lists, images, and links.
Create a simple form with fields for user information (name, email, message).
Make sure the page is well-organized with headings and clear separation of sections using appropriate HTML tags.
Expected Outcomes:

Interns should be able to create a well-structured HTML document that follows the best practices in terms of semantics and accessibility.
Interns will demonstrate the ability to organize content with headings and lists, as well as embed images and forms properly.
Tools/Resources:

Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, or any preferred IDE)
Browser (for testing)
MDN Web Docs or W3Schools for references
Support:

Interns can reach out to the mentor for guidance with debugging code or understanding HTML best practices.
Regular check-ins to ensure tasks are progressing smoothly.
